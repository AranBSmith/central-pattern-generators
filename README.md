# central-pattern-generators
Some notebooks of central pattern generators that I implemented from research papers.
There is very little to learn from in terms of implementation online, or on Github so I thought this would be a nice resource to share. 

The CPGs presented here are basic oscillation, and locomotion for hip joints that rotate forward in a circle, which require both a swing, and stance phase. More info can be found in the notebook.
